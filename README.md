Generative Adversarial Network for Logo Generation 
Intoduction
Using TensorFlow, we developed a model based on this concept. Our approach involves training basic gan to generate logos and  conditional generative adversarial network to generate logo based on prompt. It's conditioned on text descriptions, allowing it to generate logos corresponding to those descriptions.

Datasets

We used the "parquet" format for these datasets, accessible at the links provided for logo-wizard/modern-logo-dataset.
